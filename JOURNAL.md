I have made the schematic and finished it. search for the key switches and where to buy them to add them to the BOM.

worked for 2 hours, estimated, but with the hackatime sickness it shows 23m :(.

In the same day, but afternoon I added all the footprints. I got Scoopkeebs footprints to use, they were soooo helpful. and made the PCB and added the 3D designs and remains only the ROUTINGGGG ;).

Finished routing the PCB, and it was a nightmare routing everything needed a good space, but making the diodes routing from bottom and the switches from top was soo helpful and made routing more EZ. and making the fill method for the GND in all the components made it way easier and professional. Now it is all done. Only remains the Case now with Onshape.

worked on the case and finished the basics, it is like a brick now, it is kinda ugly. So, it needs more improvements. Just making a plate and a bottom without any polish is not enough. but for now i used [KLE](https://keyboard-layout-editor.com) to make the layout and export it to json so i can put it in [swillkb](http://builder.swillkb.com/) to get the dxf and import it into onshape so i can make the plate perfectly and i manually add the oled screen holes and the macros holes on Top. <br>

# 23/7/2025 it's been so long because I had a problem, but I'm back.
Worked on improving the case and enhancing its appearance and found that the red and black colors are so cool to use, also i made like a hand holder in the bottom of the keyboard. And it is all now done.
I loved my name so much, it is so cool on the case. I learned how to make an in-context part studio so I can edit my case while I see my keyswitches' location to add the holes.

I got [kbfirmware](https://kbfirmware.com/) it uses QMK to build a hex file so I can put it in the Raspberry Pi Pico to make the keyboard work, but the keyboard layout in the PCB was different so I edited all the keys so they can be the same as the PCB <br>
Now I'm ready to submit.

I changed the keyboard case to be more polished, so I added a skull and snakes on the case to be more related to my project name, snakeboard.<br>
I also made the USB hole because I forgot to add it. Rounding the edges was very important too, it is moooooore goood now with the rounded edges. I left the down edges so it can be more static on the table.<br>
